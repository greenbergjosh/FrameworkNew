##Patch Files

The dependency *Syncfusion PivotView* has a bug.

See:

- https://onpointg.atlassian.net/browse/CHN-594
- https://www.syncfusion.com/feedback/33491/error-when-filtering-with-allowdeferedlayoutupdate-and-an-olap-data-source

Until Syncfusion integrates the fix into their code, we have to apply a patch.

- To apply the patch, in the interface-builder-plugins root run:
`yarn postinstall`
