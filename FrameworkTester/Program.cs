// What is a sample program that highlights the benefits of the framework
// What shows that the framework is more flexible

// A static series of items (Sequence)
// On each item, a static series of items (Nested sequence)
// Select the different items (Conditionals)
// Iteration
// Yielding
// Historical navigation
// Parallel navigation each with history
// CMS-style composition
// Events, Aggregation, Reporting, etc. (CAP, Inversion, ...)
// IGenericEntity/Evaluatable (what is this? lifting?) (Graph, Cache, Poking, ...)
// Offer, Page,
// Customer service UI with sticky agents based on signals
// Extend into UI design, with react module federation and navtree pruning/sharing

// We start with some static version that cannot yield and has no history
// Then, piece by piece we add in the parts of the framework that get us to the full version

// Customer journey
// Start simple
// 1. show one static page to the consumer
// 2. show one question to a call center agent
// 3. load one file into a database, one time
