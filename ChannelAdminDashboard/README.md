#Channel Admin Dashboard
An admin panel for editing and managing LBMs, configured reports,
 and global imports.

##Running the Project

* Install node and npm
* In this directory, run `npm intall` to download dependencies
* Run `npm run build` to run the webpack bundler
* Run the project in VisualStudio(?)

This should open a web browser to localhost:3000 where the admin
will be visible.

##Development

* After code changes in the Content directory, simply run `npm run build` again and refresh the browser.
* After code changes to the C# code, restart the server in Visual Studio. No `npm` needed.
